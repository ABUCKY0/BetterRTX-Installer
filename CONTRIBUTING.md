Localization will be added with version 1.0.1. We need your help translating it. Do NOT USE GOOGLE TRANSLATE.

1. Fork this Repository, and select the prerelease branch
2. Download the language file from [here](https://github.com/ABUCKY0/BetterRTX-Installer/raw/prerelease/Localized/en/BetterRTX_Installer.psd1). (https://github.com/ABUCKY0/BetterRTX-Installer/raw/prerelease/Localized/en-US/BetterRTX_Installer.psd1)
3. Translate all strings from the right of each `=` sign, making sure that it makes sense Gramatically. 
4. Find the language you translated [here](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry). (http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry)
5. Make a folder in /Localized with the subtag of your language. 

> (In this case, I would be translating english. So I title my folder `en` and would upload the psd1 file I made there.

6. Make a pull request to the main repository, and I will merge it if everything looks correct.
