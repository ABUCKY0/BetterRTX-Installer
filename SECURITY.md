# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

|  Version  | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
|  v1.0.0   | :stop_sign:        |
|  v1.1.0 (Pre-Release) | :stop_sign: |
|  v1.1.0   | :stop_sign:        |
|  v1.1.1   | :white_check_mark: |

Pre-Releases will have partial support, but you may be redirected to try with the Stable Release before receiving more support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DO NOT OPEN AN ISSUE WITH THE ISSUES TAB FOR A SECURITY ISSUE. 
This is dangerous as it makes flaws public before we can mitigate them. 
Please use the Security tab at the top of the page to report a security issue to us.
